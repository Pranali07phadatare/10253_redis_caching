1. Set Up Redis:
Make sure you have Redis installed and running. You can download Redis from the official Redis website and follow the installation instructions. Once Redis is installed, start the Redis server.
2. Add Redis Dependencies to Your Project:
If you're using a Java Spring Boot application, for example, you can add the Spring Data Redis dependency to your project.
. Configure Redis Connection:
In your application properties or YAML file, configure the connection to the Redis server:

Adjust the host and port properties based on your Redis server configuration.

4. Enable Caching in Your Application:
In your Spring Boot application, enable caching by using the @EnableCaching annotation in your main application class.

Use @Cacheable Annotation:
In your service or repository methods, use the @Cacheable annotation to specify that the results of the method should be cached. 

6. Configure Cache Expiry (Optional):
You can configure the expiration time for cached entries. For example, to set a 10-second expiry time:

 Verify Caching:
You can monitor Redis using tools like Redis CLI or a Redis GUI to see cached entries and their expiration times.

That's it! You've set up caching with Redis in your Spring Boot application. Adjust the cache names, configurations, and annotations based on your specific requirements.
